# ðŸŽ¨ Art History Bootcamp

## Description

Landing page for an Art Course created with Bootstrap and customised CSS. This project was created following Traversy Media tutorial on YouTube.

It is built in HTML and CSS using the Bootstrap framework. 

I loved it because it helped me use and better understand Bootstrap.
